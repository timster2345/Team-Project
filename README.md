# Module Three Project Log - Team Development: QA and Testing Plan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:

	This is a link to our Traceability matrix shared sheet, Progress report, and Bug Logging/Reporting

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KpdF89GPGYpo2FlIlOBGkJEquXuXN8aowqep_sIkugs/edit?usp=sharing

Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage

	Will test as we submit updates to the repository. A buddy will be assigned to each submission to run tests.
We have a shared sheet in the traceability matrix for testing. Each Component of the Project will have Test Feature, Description of Test, Pass/Fail, Bugs, Runtime Errors, Updates/Error and Resolution.													
Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project

	During Sunday team meetings, will have group testing in addition to submission tests.
Discussion will be vocal and written via Discord.  Simultaneous traceability matrix review, progress review, and bug report review.

Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
	Code release will be tested as a group during group meetings. Simultaneous traceability matrix review, progress review, and bug report review. Team play review will help catch anything last minute.  Group testing via voice chat in discord. 


What items will be tested? Include a checklist of items to be tested (pass/fail).
Pickups
Collectible
Interactables
Character
Movement
Jump
Obstacles
Puzzle
Level Design
Damage System
Victory System
UI/Widgets
Health System

How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
The traceability matrix is shared on Google docs and we’re all set as editors. This will allow us to update each other on our progress as we continue to work. We will discuss our progress during group scrum meetings each week.

How will bugs be reported?
Bugs will be reported via discord in the “Bugs” Text channel as an announcement. A Bug support ticket will be submitted with details in the “Bugs” sheet of the Traceability matrix.

Bug report format:
Bug’s category
Description of the bug
Intended activity
Activity
Is it replicable
Date bug occurred
Level of severity (1-10)
Bugs will have deadlines based on severity level: 10s need to be fixed in 1day (game breaking), 7-9 in 3 days, 4-6 in 7 days, 1-3 in 10 days.
Current status
Any notes
Steps to resolution

How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
 A Bug support ticket will be submitted with details in the “Bugs” sheet of the Traceability matrix. This will serve as both documentation and tracking of the bug and its resolution	
Traceability matrix has a bug reporting 



Module 4


-What parts of the testing process did the team perceive to go well?
Communicating when assets are finished and letting other team members test it, to get a fresh pair of eyes in case something was missed. 

-How were bugs identified and corrected?
Communication was perfect, team members appropriately communicated the issue and filled out the appropriate bug report sheet with accurate information about the bug and what was supposed to happen compared to what happened. This is what we want to happen when bugs are encountered. 

-In terms of the QA and testing process, what would you do differently to improve the process?
Implementing a team play method to test all assets as a whole and communicate clear timeframes for each feature, so that we do not spend too much time on things that are not required.

-What tools (chosen in Module Two) did you find successful in the development of your Alpha project? Why?
Discord has been useful in terms of communication via verbal, text, image, and linking documents, while the traceability matrix has proven useful in terms of updates, responsibilities, and reports. Added a level design sheet to the matrix to get a visual of where components will be positioned as well as the overall puzzle layout. 

-Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
Communication through email was mentioned, but not utilized, as Discord has proven to be useful in this area. 

-How did the team approach to the initial analysis of the game design document contribute to the decision to use these tools and techniques?
Since we knew we had to design a sidescroller 2D level, we decided to utilize Google Sheets to map out the single level layout, which was also useful for real time updates and not having to pass a single spreadsheet back and forth. The traceability matrix and Google sheets allowed us to check out who was working on a specific asset, so multiple members did not work on the same thing simultaneously. 

Module 5

-What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage evaluation?
Bug reporting methods went well; We kept up with testing each other's feature adds and reported any bugs found in our matrix. We reported in discord as well so the bug could be followed up with in a certain period of time.
We followed through with our team play time. This successfully coordinated us and we got on the same page about bug priorities and feature priorities. This is what we were aiming for with teamplay.

-What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage evaluation?
We haven’t encountered anything that outright went wrong. We’ve planned for bugs and setbacks and adjusted accordingly. When one member struggles, they reach out and get help from the group or handoff the bug to another member for fresh eyes.

-How were the previous evaluations integrated into this latest stage?
We implemented a system in our traceability matrix so members could “check out” features to work on and prevent overlapping work, and merge conflicts. 
While no issues were reported we improved on our previous success, and furthered our bug reporting and resolving abilities.

-What would you do differently to improve the collaboration or development process?
Utilize all our development resources such as discord groups, Unreal message boards, Game dev groups, and use clear code comments more frequently.

-Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
While not all tools were used equally, every one served its purpose and we were able to integrate/test them in our development process.

-Identify the completed stage of development of the intended Beta and address the project schedule to meet Final Release development deadline.
For this Beta, we finished off Pickups, Interactables, Character movement, and the Damage system. For the final release, we’re finishing the Health system, UI, the puzzle, the overgrowth door and the pieces to pass it.
