How will you test objects, levels, and games during the development cycle? Develop a schedule and include:

	This is a link to our Traceability matrix shared sheet, Progress report, and Bug Logging/Reporting

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KpdF89GPGYpo2FlIlOBGkJEquXuXN8aowqep_sIkugs/edit?usp=sharing

Play Test: Testing during the preproduction stage

	Will test as we submit updates to the repository. A buddy will be assigned to each submission to run tests.
We have a shared sheet in the traceability matrix for testing. Each Component of the Project will have Test Feature, Description of Test, Pass/Fail, Bugs, Runtime Errors, Updates/Error and Resolution.													
Demo: Testing before marketing will demo the project

	During Sunday team meetings, will have group testing in addition to submission tests.
Discussion will be vocal and written via Discord.  Simultaneous traceability matrix review, progress review, and bug report review.

Code Release: Checking the code release demo with the test plan
	Code release will be tested as a group during group meetings. Simultaneous traceability matrix review, progress review, and bug report review. Team play review will help catch anything last minute.  Group testing via voice chat in discord.

How will you update the test plan to reflect changes to the game and design document?
The traceability matrix is shared on Google docs and we’re all set as editors. This will allow us to update each other on our progress as we continue to work. We will discuss our progress during group scrum meetings each week.

How will bugs be reported?
Bugs will be reported via discord in the “Bugs” Text channel as an announcement. A Bug support ticket will be submitted with details in the “Bugs” sheet of the Traceability matrix.

Bug report format:
Bug’s category
Description of the bug
Intended activity
Activity
Is it replicable
Date bug occurred
Level of severity (1-10)
Bugs will have deadlines based on severity level: 10s need to be fixed in 1day (game breaking), 7-9 in 3 days, 4-6 in 7 days, 1-3 in 10 days.
Current status
Any notes
Steps to resolution

How will the bugs and their changes be tracked over time?
 A Bug support ticket will be submitted with details in the “Bugs” sheet of the Traceability matrix. This will serve as both documentation and tracking of the bug and its resolution	
Traceability matrix has a bug reporting
